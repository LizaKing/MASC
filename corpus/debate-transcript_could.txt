My opponent just this weekend talked about how terrorism could be reduced to a nuisance , comparing it to prostitution , illegal gambling .
I blame the president for the things the president could do that has an impact on it .
We could have done that in Medicare .
Now , what happens is when you begin to get people covered like that -- for instance in diabetes , if you diagnose diabetes early , you could save $50 billion in the health care system of America by avoiding surgery and dialysis .
We could speed it up .
Is there any relief that could be offered to these brave Americans and their families ?
And I regret to say that this administration has even blocked steps that could help us move further along .
Can I say , if I could just say a word about a woman that you did n't ask about , but my mom passed away a couple years ago , just before I was deciding to run .
