In the case of midden work , Antie must be able to identify garbage , grasp it , carry it out of the nest , and deposit it about halfway down the mound before returning to repeat the process ad infinitum ( or until stimulated to switch behaviors ) .
An ant engaged in nest patrolling must exit the nest at the proper time in the morning and wander about for a bit on the nest mound , presumably taking measurements of the temperature and humidity in some way and making sure that it is safe for the other ants to exit .
An ant engaged in trail patrolling must exit the nest , wander around searching for food sources , identify food upon discovery and return to the nest to show the foragers where the food is .
In addition to following these trails to the food , foragers must also be able to identify food , grasp it and carry it back to the nest .
Ants engaged in all three behaviors must be able to identify other nestmates and their current tasks ( as well as indicate to other ants their own nestmate status and current task ) , walk , navigate both within and outside of the nest , and of course switch tasks at appropriate times .
It will be initiated in the morning by the sunrise , and will continue until the outside temperature reaches 52 C , at which point all red harvester ants must return to the nest .
As previously stated , a midden worker must identify midden , grasp it , and carry it to the surface , depositing it halfway down the mound before returning to collect more midden .
This will emulate the digging that foragers must often do in order to locate seeds , and will enable Antie to accurately retrieve seeds for its host nest .
