The 14-hour flight took me from Monday morning in Sydney to Monday morning , again , in L.A. Crossing the date line messed up my sense of time enough without the added bonus of thinking I should be heading to bed just as the sun began to climb into the California sky .
Everyone I 've talked to who has previously attended says wonderful things about it ; this semester , one of my friends told me she was going : I should join her !
When we talked about the giving , and how one should try to give what one could to other sentient beings ( in the form of material items , kind words , protection , and so on ) , Khenpo Kalsang shared a story of the Buddha , and how the Buddha had given his flesh so that a family of hungry tigers could eat .
