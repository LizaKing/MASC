I must .
And if I can brag and digress so easily , this must not be painful enough to merit a mindwipe , yes ?
This logic does not soothe her ; she says I must wait three weeks .
I went on a spree , and it must have been a good one .
I stand up , I walk around , I pretend someone makes a vid about a writer and I must enact every cliche .
I must also write about Emiliano Gabriel Malaquez .
I do not plan to write a book : this narrative must move more quickly .
You must be Bernardo .
And then you must forgive me for being so forward .
I must change my subject matter .
I muttered something he must have interpreted as assent .
A cold front must have hit while I was inside .
It must have been larger than my finger .
It must have been wishful thinking .
I must have fallen to the floor then .
