I really truly do mean that , because I do n't think that should be the focus of this case .
So having said that , their fear is that because of all those municipalities that they cover and the school districts that they cover , that at least in the Middle District Court , should a matter come up similar to this case , then they are exposed as a fact witness .
Then I think you should reschedule the depositions and try to do that .
Are you suggesting that this language should apply to both the depositions and the trial testimony ?
What 's your intention , what are your thoughts regarding how we should address this ?
And so if you do n't believe everything in the newspapers , do n't you think before you became a plaintiff in a lawsuit that you should have taken some personal action to verify whether things that were produced in a newspaper were really accurate ?
Because my husband and I had left early -- we had our infant with us and he needed to get home -- we had heard that there were comments that were said after we left about teachers should be fired if they do n't listen to the school board 's directive .
Maybe we should ask .
This country was founded on Christianity , and our students should be taught as such .
