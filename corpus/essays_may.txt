Interactive fiction like video games , on the other hand , presents violence in a narrative context , which may very well desensitize participants to said violence , but no causative link has ever been proven .
Moore 's second hypothesis is that America 's foreign policy may contribute to the belief that violence is an appropriate means to solve conflicts , a hypothesis which is shared by many sociologists and psychologists .
You make the hysterical claim that the interview " may be faked " ( on the basis that no name is shown for the interviewee ) , but if Moore had faked it , why the hell should he put this sentence in the protestor 's mouth , which directly contradicts the conclusion that the rally happened hours after Kayla 's death ?
Opinions may vary on how tasteless it was for Heston to hold a pro gun rally on the location of the nation 's youngest school shooting months after the fact , but this sequence of " Bowling " is without doubt the most unfair to Heston .
The behaviors of the sterile workers may be divided into several subcategories : brood care , nest maintenance , patrolling and foraging .
Patrolling may be divided into two distinct sub-behaviors , nest patrolling and trail patrolling .
Perhaps the level of degradation of the nest patrollers cuticular hydrocarbons after this short foray into the sun and heat acts as an indication of the outside conditions to the foragers , who may then , upon smelling the returning patroller , be stimulated either to forage or to remain inactive inside the nest .
This is thought to be accomplished by the deposition of chemical markers from a gland on the abdomen that the patroller drags along the ground on her return route to the nest that the foragers may then follow ( Gordon , 33 - 34 ; Holldobler et al , 1990 , as cited in Webb , 1998 ) .
Ants themselves rely primarily on chemical information taken in through their antennae , and to mimic this , Antie will have chemical sensing and emitting ' stalks ' with which to both interact with other ants ( who may be surprised to find an ant without antennae ) and take in chemical information .
These sensors will be of the type patented by Peterson , et al ( Patent # 4 , 492,949 ) , and will feature several layers of electrically insulating and parallel flexible conductive rods arranged such that an exerted pressure may be measured in output voltage .
We may assume that this first function will return a direction in degrees , positive or negative , and that the second function will return a distance in centimeters .
The code may look something like this :
Research has shown that red harvester ants may identify the tasks nestmates are engaged in based on the ratio of n-alkenes to n-alkanes in their hydrocarbons and the presence or absence of branched n-alkanes .
The code will be similar to the object identification subroutine and may look something like this :
As tempting as this interpretation may be , this observation is relegated to the notes section because it constitutes a horrible abuse of terminology â€” there is only so far that such tonal analogies can go before they begin to hide any true analytical insight behind misused terms .
Youngstown may have been an important and prosperous region in the post-war period , but the seeds for its downfall were slowly being sown .
What happened in Youngstown may not seem significant on an international or even on a national level , and perhaps it is not .
